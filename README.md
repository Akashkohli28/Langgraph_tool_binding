# 🛠️ LangGraph Tool Binding Project

This notebook demonstrates how to build an **agentic graph** using [LangGraph](https://docs.langchain.com/langgraph/) where agents are capable of **binding and using tools**. These tools help the agents perform specific tasks such as calculations, searches, or calling custom APIs — all within a structured, state-managed graph.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- 🔁 Multi-step, multi-agent communication using LangGraph
- 🔗 Integration of external tools into agents' decision-making
- 🧠 Use of OpenAI LLMs to reason and choose tools
- ⚙️ Custom function binding (e.g., calculator, search, etc.)
- 📊 Visualization of agent state transitions
